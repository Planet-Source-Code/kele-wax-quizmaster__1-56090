### Description

This is a quiz administration programme. It was created with the military in mind (Navy) so to login you use an official number and a password.There are two groups of users, the administrators and the students.

An adminstrator would have access to the questions database (being able to modify it or add new questions), he can also set the conditions for taking the test like number of questions type of questions and duration of test. Only an administrator can register or modify or delete other users. He also has access to all test scores and can prune the database.

The questions are stored according to subjects and could be in form of True/False, Multiple Choice or Short Answer type. Each question can be associated with a picture.

A student can either take a test of check his scores.

All users can change there password anytime.

Even though the application was written to suit the military it can easily be modified.

Please leave you comments and views, as I am sure I still have a great deal to learn.

I have indeed learnt alot from this great site and most of this code can be traced to this site. I am really gratefull to all members of PSC.
